Steps to follwo:

1. LaserScanner on Husky
2. Place objects, input data. 
3. Building a cost function using the data derived. 
4. Final and intial position known. Escape obstacles
5. Build an optimizer to optimize the cost function and obtain the new pointing angle
6. Reach the goal to a certain tolerance and stop.


Finish a rudimentary form of this in 1 day itself


General INFO:

1. LaserScan range - -135 degrees to 135 degrees
2. Number of range readings - 720 readings


Progress:

1. Implemented LaserScanner that outputs positive message if an object lies between -20 and 20 degrees of the pointing angle.
